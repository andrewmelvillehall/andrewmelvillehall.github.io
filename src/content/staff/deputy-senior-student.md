bio: "My name is Ellie Harrison, I am a 4th year International Relations
Student and have lived in Andrew Melville Hall since 1st year. I started
in the AMH committee as Charities Officer and have been Deputy Senior
Student for the past two years. My role as Deputy Senior Student is to
be supportive to the rest of the committee, my main responsibility is
logistics for the committee (organising who should be where and when). I
have thoroughly enjoyed working with such a dedicated team, and being
part of the committee has given me a real sense of belonging within the
hall community. Living in Andrew Melville Hall has been a highlight of
my university experience, and I am proud to contribute to making it an
enjoyable place for everyone."
