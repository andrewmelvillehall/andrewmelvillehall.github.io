bio: "The wonderfully humble Rev. Wiseman! You ever go to an AMH event? It's been organised by me - free bars, the ball, other social events, and of course the Caf√© (my baby). Otherwise, I also sit on the executive committee which means I help manage and wrangle the general committee and do executive stuff (browse amazon for decorations and complain about the bar being cluttered)."
favouriteThing: "Social spirit! You can walk into any room and have a great time and conversation with everyone there! The free bars are pretty good too..."
