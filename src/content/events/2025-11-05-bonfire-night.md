## Free Bar and then a Bonfire!!

It's that time of the year again when West Sands becomes a place of
peril as students try their hand at setting off fireworks (hint: they
are supposed to go up!).

Join us for a free bar before we all walk down to the beach and have a
bonfire of our own. Make sure to wrap up warm!

### Important

- Bring a cup!
- Remember to drink responsibly 🍷🍺
- Be careful around fire! Fire hot 🔥. Human no like hot.
- Wear something warm, it is November after all
