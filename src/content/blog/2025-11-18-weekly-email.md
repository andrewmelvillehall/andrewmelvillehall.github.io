Hello Melvillites,

Hope everyone is doing well and managing to find time to relax this
deadline season.

## Melville Ball

The first event we have this week is the one and only Melville Ball, for
those of you who are yet to purchase a ticket you still can at the stall
in reception until stocks last. Tickets will be ready to collected at
Thursday & Friday dinner time in reception. Get hyped Melville ball is
an amazing night.

## Christmas Dinner and Free Bar

Christmas dinner this year will be on the 28th of November, attire is
red-gown and/or Christmas jumpers to get in the festive mood. This will
be followed by a festive free bar which will be the last free bar of the
semester. So dig out your festive attire and practice your Christmas
carols for a fabulously festive night.

## Semester 1 Hall Photo

This semesters Hall Photo will take place on the 29th of November on the
front grass of Melville, timings will come soon.

## Walk and Cafe

Our holistic representative, Brett, is running his nature walk again
this week from 10-12. It is a fantastic way to relax and decompress
before the new week.

After lunch, Crows Nest Cafe will be open again from 2-4pm so make sure
you get some tea, coffee, chai, matcha or hot chocolate!

## Football

This Sunday there will also be an AMH football game at the hockey
pitches from 3-5, for more information contact Ben Montague.

## For the Creatives

In Melville we currently have two art submissions.

If you would like to be in for a chance of winning free AMH Merchandise,
design an Andrew Melville Hall Crest and submit it to our Social Media
and Merchandise Officer, Felicity, by the 25th of November.

If you like to draw we also would appreciate more drawings for the Crows
Nest Cafe Colouring.

## On a more serious note

We thought it would be important to remind you that any damages to the
hall come out of the committee budget, this includes vomit that is left
uncleaned! The committee are also unpaid volunteers so it is not our
responsibility to clean up/ fix what you break. So either clean up after
yourselves or drinks at the free bar are going to be gone even faster.

That is all from us, I hope you all have a great week!

All the Best

Ellie Harrison (Deputy Senior Student)
